Tnym-js is an automated tool to spam users on the noted website [Tellonym](https://tellonym.me/).

## Features

- A very fast spammer.
- Captcha bypass on message sending.
- Easy interface to use.
- Nothing external needed to install.

**A known and big problem is how large the program is because of Electron. If you are a dev and know how to fix this, please feel free to do a PR.**
